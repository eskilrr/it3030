# it3030
Deep learning projects for the subject it3030 deep learning. All projects required a lot of work, and each project had to be shown to an examinator with a run through
the code as well as an explanation of the different parts. 
## Project 1
The project focused on making a basic vanilla neural network from scratch to be used on a self made dataset consisting of data with 4 different labels. 
Got a score of 28/30 from the examinator.
## Project 2
This project focused also on making a neural network from scratch, but this time it was a convolutional neural network which is superior on classifying data with 
bigger internal patterns as for example pictures. A harder project than the first one, and required a huge amount of work.
Got a score of 22/25 from the examinator.
## Project 3
In this project i made an autoencoder using the pyTorch library. The point is to train a network on unlabeled data, and then use the decoder part to train the
network further on labeled data. This is very useful when you possess lots of unlabeled data. Had to be tested on three different benchmark datasets.
Got a score of 20/21 from the examinator.
